*Daily Task manager*

Allows users to input tasks and define the days they'd like them to be completed.

Front page checks the current day and displays all applicable tasks. A team of workers could use this like a dashboard.

Tasks can be updated by pressing the 'Complete Task' button and reset the task by clicking 'Reset'.

- Extend beyond one person / team (user associations etc.)
- Build test suite (naughty, I know)
- Add realtime update of tasks on the home page.
